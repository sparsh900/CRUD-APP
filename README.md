# CRUD-APP

TO START THE BACKEND SERVER:
1. install the latest version of NODE on the system (link) (also add to the path)
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. change the folder location to /backend in terminal
    cd backend
    
3. run the command 
    "npm install"

4. to start the node.js server run the command 
    "node index,js"
    
 Now Node server is started at port 8000 and connected to mongodb database
 
 
 TO START THE REACT WEBSITE:
 1. change the folder location to /frontend in terminal
    cd frontend
    
 2. run the command 
    "npm install"
    
 3. To start the react website run the command
      "npm start"
      
  Now the react site gets opened in browser on port 3000
  
  after opening the website you get to see a form for adding products (product name, product description) and you can also delete them from the cart.
  Also, I have implemented an extra feature of export to CSV format by which we get to download all the data of the cart we added in CSV file.
